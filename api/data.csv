191,ToggUltima,DrakenStark,SDK3,"An UdonSharp toggle script with optional components built to minimize world development workload and also provide a wide variety of functionality. Give your interactive objects an Action script and fly from there!

- Toggle multiple objects at once with a single interactive object in a variety of ways. Decorate your mirror walls and temporarily disable the decorations while the mirror is enabled.
- List all your mirrors or other objects in one script and have them automatically disabled when not in use! No need to manage the same list multiple times across all your interactive objects to protect everyone's framerates.
- Sync your toggles together with ease (Drag toggle scripts into an array and done!) and with minimal network traffic (One variable is used to sync together all the toggle scripts you put in it!).
- Reserve your interactive objects with a bouncer script that allows you to have a list of who you want and don't want to be able to use them.
- Feel free to use multiple sets of these scripts for any number of separate systems within your worlds! One sync script can still be used for all of them if desired!
